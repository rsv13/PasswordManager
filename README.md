# Password Manager

## Overview

The **Password Manager** is a secure, command-line application designed to help users and administrators manage their passwords and other credentials. It allows users to register, log in, and store various credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords, etc.) securely. Administrators have additional features to manage user data, credentials, and other sensitive information.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:**
  - Users can register with a username, email, and password.
  - Users can log in with their credentials to access and manage their stored information.

- **Admin Registration & Login:**
  - Admins can register with personal details (name, date of birth, phone number, and email).
  - Admins can log in with their credentials to manage users and view all stored credentials.

- **Credential Management:**
  - Users can store and manage multiple credentials (e.g., login details for websites).
  - Credentials are stored with details such as the service name, username, password, and last updated date.

- **Admin Features:**
  - Admins can view the list of users and admins.
  - Admins can view, edit, or delete any user's credentials.
  - Admins can delete user accounts.

- **Password Generation:**
  - Users can either enter their own password or choose to generate a secure random password.
  
- **Secure Authentication:**
  - Passwords are validated to ensure they meet certain security criteria (at least 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character).

## Setup & Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later** is required to run the application.
- A **command-line interface (CLI)** to execute the program.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rsv13/PasswordManager.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd PasswordManager
   ```

3. **Compile the Java files:**

   Make sure to compile all the `.java` files in the `src` directory.

   ```bash
   javac src/passman/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   After compiling the code, run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   java passman.Passman
   ```

## Usage

### User Registration

1. Select the option to **register as a User**.
2. Enter your username, email, and password.
3. Once registered, the user can log in to manage and view their credentials.

### Admin Registration

1. Select the option to **register as an Admin**.
2. Enter personal information (name, phone number, email, etc.).
3. Admins can optionally provide an ID proof (e.g., passport, driver's license).
4. Admins can set their own password or let the system generate one for them.

### User Login

1. After registering, users can log in with their email and password.
2. Once logged in, users can perform actions like creating, editing, deleting, and searching for credentials.

### Admin Login

1. Admins can log in with their email and password.
2. Admins have access to additional features like:
   - Viewing all users and admins.
   - Managing user credentials (view, edit, delete).
   - Deleting users.

### Password Management

- Users can store and view credentials (service names, usernames, passwords, and the last updated date).
- Admins can view and manage any user's credentials.

## Code Structure

The application is divided into several key classes, as detailed below:

- **`Passman.java`**: The main class that handles the core logic of the application. This includes user registration, login, and interaction with the database.
- **`User.java`**: Represents a user, containing methods for managing user credentials.
- **`Admin.java`**: Represents an admin, with extended functionality to manage users and credentials.
- **`PassManDatabase.java`**: Simulates a database that stores users, admins, and credentials.
- **`Credential.java`**: Represents an individual credential (username, password, last updated date).
- **`RandomPasswordGenerator.java`**: A utility class for generating secure random passwords.

### `Passman.java` - Main Application Flow

This is where the main menu is displayed, and the user is prompted to choose an action (register, login, etc.). Based on the choice, the corresponding methods are called to either register the user/admin, authenticate the login, or manage credentials.

### `User.java` - User Functionality

Users can create new credentials, view stored credentials, edit or delete existing credentials, and search through them. They can also sort credentials based on the last updated date.

### `Admin.java` - Admin Functionality

Admins have access to all user credentials and can perform actions such as:
- Viewing the list of users and admins.
- Editing or deleting any user's credentials.
- Deleting user accounts.

### `PassManDatabase.java` - Database Simulation

This class simulates a simple in-memory database that stores all users, admins, and credentials. It also handles the authentication of users and admins by verifying their email and password.

## Password Validation

Passwords are validated based on the following criteria:
- At least 8 characters in length.
- Contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (`@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `+`, `=`).
